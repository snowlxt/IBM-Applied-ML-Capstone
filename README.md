The commercial space age is coming, companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. SpaceX is one of success. 
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because  SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.
